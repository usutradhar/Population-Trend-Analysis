# Population-Trend-Analysis
Analysis of population trends in the U.S. cities. We looked into three questions:
(1)	What are the future population trends in all U.S. cities up to 2100; in particular, how many cities are likely to depopulate?
(2)	Where are these depopulating cities?
(3)	What are the characteristics of these depopulating cities in terms of income, vehicle ownership and degree of urbanization?
